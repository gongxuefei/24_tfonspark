# MNIST

Original Source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/dist_test/python/mnist_replica.py

Note: this has been heavily modified to support different input formats (CSV and TFRecords) as well as to demonstrate the different data ingestion methods (feed_dict and QueueRunner).

Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark/wiki/GetStarted_YARN) to run this example.
